## NLW Return Impulse
This was the conclusion of a week of classes from Rocketseat [NLW Return - Impulse Event](https://lp.rocketseat.com.br/nlw-return). This was very challenging but the teaching approach was amazing, really condensed but at the same time I've probably learned more here in a week than a month of Udemy classes. This was my first contact with NodeJS, React Mobile and Typescript, still need a lot of practice and study with both, but I am already incorporating Typescript into my daily practice.

The challenge was to build a "Feedget" App, a somewhat basic (not my words) app that you can click and expand into a Text Input where you can select 3 options, being them Send a Bug, Send an Idea, Send Other. Then you type something and you can take a screenshot of the screen and send it. It included the web, server and mobile sections, it was divided into five days, being the first two the Web, third was Server, fourth Mobile and fifth Deploy.

### What I've Learned

- Using Vite and configuring it myself
- Tailwind CSS (a lifechanger honestly, sorry SASS)
- My first contact with Typescript
- A lot of React
- Using accessibility libraries, and not only for accessibility, but also as a tool. In this case we used [Headless UI](https://headlessui.dev/)
- The use of Prisma to build the server
- Also first time with NodeJS, still need to learn a lot
- First time using React Native, somewhat similar, but at the same time different enough to require a lot of study
- First time doing Unit Testing

### Personal Difficulties and What I need to Work on

- More practice with React
- A lot of study on Typescript, haven't yet grasped the concepts very well
- Had a lot of difficulty with the server deploy, could not make it work, still working on it
- It was my first time with NodeJS and Typescript, but I feel NodeJS is not as important as Typescript for me right now
- Need to research more the accessibility libraries and include them
- Unit Testing, I understand the importance, but I am somewhat lost on this subject
