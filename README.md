## NLW Return Impulse
This was the conclusion of a week of classes from Rocketseat [NLW Return - Impulse Event](https://lp.rocketseat.com.br/nlw-return). This was very challenging but the teaching approach was amazing, really condensed but at the same time I've probably learned more here in a week than a month of Udemy classes. This was my first contact with NodeJS, React Native and Typescript, still need a lot of practice and study with all of them, but I am already incorporating Typescript into my daily practice.

The challenge was to build a "Feedget" App, a somewhat basic (not my words) app that you can click and expand into a Text Input where you can select 3 options, being them Send a Bug, Send an Idea, Send Other. Then you type something and you can take a screenshot of the screen and send it. It included the web, server, mobile and also a deploy sections. It was divided into five days, being the first two the Web, third was Server, fourth Mobile and fifth Deploy.

### What I've Learned

- Using Vite and configuring it myself
- Got a lot of practice with the CLI and installing of components
- Tailwind CSS (a lifechanger honestly, sorry SASS)
- My first contact with Typescript
- A lot of React
- Using accessibility libraries, and not only for accessibility, but also as a tool. In this case we used [Headless UI](https://headlessui.dev/)
- The use of Prisma to build the server
- Also first time with NodeJS, still need to learn a lot
- First time using React Native, somewhat similar, but at the same time different enough to require a lot of study
- First time doing Unit Testing

### Personal Difficulties and What I need to Work on

- More practice with React
- Had a little difficulty with Git, had trouble when trying to push the web project
- A lot of study on Typescript, haven't yet grasped the concepts very well
- Had a lot of difficulty with the server deploy, could not make it work, still working on it
- It was my first time with NodeJS and Typescript, but I feel NodeJS is not as important as Typescript for me right now
- Need to research more the accessibility libraries and include them
- Unit Testing, I understand the importance, but I am somewhat lost on this subject
